General ,,
"The annual update of the “U.S. Overseas Loans and Grants”, informally known as the “Greenbook”, contains",,
summary data of United States Government (USG) foreign assistance since 1945 and detailed annual data for the,,
last four fiscal years.,Foreign assistance is categorized as either economic assistance or military assistance.,All
"obligations for foreign assistance, as defined by the Foreign Assistance Act, are included regardless of",,
"implementing mechanism (i.e. direct hires, contracts, grants, government-to-government). Other U.S. Government",,
International Flows are also presented.,The contents of each section are explained in further detail below. ,
"Foreign assistance is reported by recipient country and organized by geographic region, without distinction",,
between developed and developing countries.,"The report includes a world summary page, regional summary",
pages and individual country pages.,,
"Any country which has received cumulative economic or military assistance over $500,000 since 1945 and is",,
"considered an “Independent State” by the U.S. Department of State merits an individual country page. Generally,",,
country names are those officially designated by the U.S. Department of State.,,Specific information on
country/region names and groupings can be found in the Country and Regional Notes in the back of the book. ,,
"From 2001 to the present, grant data represent net obligations and loan data represent net authorizations.",,Net
obligations may be negative if deobligations are greater than obligations during the fiscal year.,,From 1955
"through 2000, annual data represent total new grant obligations and loan authorizations in the given fiscal year.",,
"Prior to 1955, grant data represent net obligations and loan data represent net authorizations.",,Where obligations
"are not available, appropriations or disbursements are used. Historical data are updated and may not reconcile ",,
with past editions of the Greenbook.,All data are reported in historical U.S. dollars.,Columns and rows may not
sum due to rounding.,"Values less than $50,000 are denoted as 0.0; a period (“.”) indicates no funding.",
The accounts that make up each row of the country pages are listed below.,All accounts are presented by funding,
"agency, except for accounts funded by the Executive Office of the President, which are credited to the ",,
implementing agency.,,
"For detailed annual data and dynamic visualizations, visit https://explorer.usaid.gov. ",,
Section Notes ,,
A brief explanation of the contents of each is provided below. Foreign assistance is comprised of economic and,,
military assistance. The economic assistance section is further divided by funding agency. For appropriations,,

provide a detailed listing of “accounts” that comprise each section and funding agency for the current year. For,,
"the purpose of this publication, “accounts” refer to Federal appropriation accounts. ",,
Economic Assistance ,,
Economic assistance is defined as foreign aid for programs with a development or humanitarian objective. ,,
"Development aid programs foster sustainable, broad-based economic progress and sociopolitical stability in",,
developing countries. Humanitarian aid programs focus on the immediate alleviation of humanitarian,,
"emergencies, both natural and man-made disasters, as well as problems resulting from conflict associated with",,
"failed or failing states. Economic assistance captures U.S. voluntary contributions to multilateral organizations,",,
"non-military security assistance, as well as humanitarian and non-military development programs funded by the",,
U.S. Department of Defense. ,,
Total economic assistance is divided among the following funding categories: United States Agency for,,
"International Development (USAID) and Predecessor, Department of Agriculture, Department of State, and Other",,

Time Period Notes ,,
"Country and regional pages contain historical summary data, the most current four years of annual data,",,
cumulative total and information on loan status.,Summary data are available for each legislative authority: Post-,
"War Relief (1946-1948), Marshall Plan (1949-1952), Mutual Security Act (1953-1961) and Foreign Assistance Act",,
(1962-present).,Detailed annual data on prior years can be found on the website at https://explorer.usaid.gov. ,
Loan Status ,,
Total loans and grants is the sum of annual data from 1945 to the present.,The portion ascribed to loans is,
reported in the “Of which Loans” column.,"The outstanding amount as of September 30th, 2019 is the total",
"amount due the U.S. Government for all loans made during the period 1946 to the present, as reported by the U.S.",,
Department of Treasury.,Decreases in the outstanding amount reflect both repayments on loans and debt,
forgiveness.,Private loans to foreign entities that are guaranteed and/or insured by the U.S. Government are not,
"included in this publication. However, obligations for the subsidy cost of guarantees, provided by appropriated",,
"funds as required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, are included in the data. Claims acquired by the U.S.",,
"Government upon default under these programs are also not included; however, capitalization of the defaults is",,
"included. Therefore, the outstanding loan balance may be greater than total loans and grants. ",,
,9,
Glossary of Terms ,,
Appropriation – an act of the United States Congress allowing US Federal Agencies to incur obligations for,,
specified purposes. ,,
"Authorization – substantive legislation that establishes legal operation of a Federal program, either indefinitely or",,
"for a specific period of time, and sanctions particular program funding levels. ",,
Economic Assistance – foreign aid for programs with a development or humanitarian objective. ,,
"Fiscal Year (FY) – an accounting period of 365 days (366 in leap years), but not necessarily starting on January 1.",,
The fiscal year of the United States Government begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 and is,,
designated by the calendar year in which it ends.,,"Prior to FY 1977, the U.S. fiscal year ran from July 1 through"

"item of real, personal, or mixed property, any agricultural commodity, United States dollars, and any currencies of",,
"any foreign country which are owned by the United States Government..."" This section further states that",,
"""...provided by the United States Government' includes, but is not limited to, foreign assistance provided by means",,
"of gift, loan, sale, credit, or guaranty."" ",,
The executive agent and place of performance do not determine whether an official transfer is foreign assistance.,,
Such designation is based on whether foreign entities receive direct benefits from programs supported by USG ,,
funds without paying for them. Most executive agents for USG assistance programs are U.S. entities. While,,
"authorized primarily under FAA, USG foreign assistance is also authorized by other legislation. Similarly, USG ",,
"foreign assistance is primarily under appropriations within budget function 150, International Affairs, in annual",,

aid which subsidizes or substantially enhances military capability. ,,
"Obligation – a binding agreement that will result in outlays, immediately or in the future.",,Budget resources must
be available before obligations can be legally incurred. ,,
